I created this project to continuously improve my skills in NextJS + Typescript, however, I've decided to continue developing it to eventually create an open-source grading platform for schools. 

This project was started in 2021 with a lot of huge gaps in development, initially delivered in Javascript & React, to be replaced with Typescript & NextJS. Since 2022, I've been working on this project regularly, adding new functionality & features.
